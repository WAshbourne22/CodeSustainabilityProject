                     Why the current clothing system doesn't work
                 </h3>
                 <p>
                    The current system for producing, distributing, and using clothing operates in an almost completely linear way. Large amounts of nonrenewable resources are extracted to produce clothes that are often only used for a short period, after which the materials are largely lost to landfill or incineration. It is estimated that more than half of fast fashion produced is disposed of in under a year.

                    Tackling this current climate of Fast Fashion can begin with the following three steps:

                Some companies are already using safe and renewable textiles to slow the impact of fast fashion, such as BAM Clothing and Hemp Clothes.
